# Movies

Purpose of this repo is to explore scrapy features and database storage.

To do so we will try to scrap a very popular movie web site (allo cine) in order to retrieve data on movies and series.

The first stage will consist in limiting the number of scrapped item to ensure all is working fine and record results in a csv file.

the second stage will consist in implementing a creating a database to be used in place of the csv file.
